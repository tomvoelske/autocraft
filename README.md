Crafting assist for FFXIV

Only designed for my own purposes, so not extremely user-friendly. Indirect input is not easy and would likely be an obvious TOS violation, thus this imitates human input by clicking in precise locations. The clicks are offset by a (pseudo)random degree of error, as are the timings, so it is not immediately obvious that a bot is doing it.

It is a flexible script which works for many things!
